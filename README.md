# Global-Warming-Finder

Using https://darksky.net/, this project is an unbiased showing of past weather data.
This way you can see for yourself wether you think global warming is real
and caused by human intervention.
There will be data pulled from DarkSky and saved into a database. 
This will then be able to be accessed for viewing in graphs and stuff on Heroku
